# GNU PLOT APPLICATION
The objective of this project is to display area and perimeter of 2D geometric shapes such as Rectangle, Triangle, Circle and Ellipse.
Take input from user in length for a particular shape and append it's co-ordinate in file. Take this file as input and plot the shape on GNU PLOT.
Abstract class Shape is inherited in every the class except Point.

The project follows a modular structure with separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files for each class.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

- **include**: Contains header files for each geometric shape class.
 
- **src**: Contains implementation files corresponding to each header file.
 
- **main.cpp**: Main source file where the program execution starts.
##  1. Rectangle
 
- Header: include/Rectangle.h
 
- Implementation: src/Rectangle.cpp
 
## 2. Triangle
 
Header: include/Triangle.h
 
Implementation: src/Triangle.cpp
 
## 3. Circle
 
Header: include/Circle.h
 
Implementation: src/Circle.cpp

## Building and Running
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
```bash
 
git clone https://github.com/SonaliPatankar/GNU-PLOT.git
